Hey!

My name is Jacob. I'm a follower of Jesus, a father, and a nerd. About that nerd part, I'm a staff software engineer who's passionate about the Swift and Kotlin languages, and the author of [this blog](https://jacobzivandesign.com). I've been fortunate enough to be mentored by some of the brightest and kindest people I've ever met. They are certainly a major part of why I've made it to where I'm at, and I'm very grateful.

I've been able to work on some great applications like:
- [Everydollar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/everydollar-personal-budget/id942571931) ‚Äî both iOS and Android before it was rewritten in Xamarin due to some C# fixated leaders
- [Kroger](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/the-kroger-co/id403901189?see-all=i-phonei-pad-apps) ‚Äî technically all of their umbrella's mobile shopping apps
- [Gazelle](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/gazelle) ‚Äî A Fintech app that didn't last (looks like they finally took down the landing page, so that like may be dead forever)
- And others that are private enterprise apps


And I was able to give a [talk](https://youtu.be/442sw_sNQ6k?t=13312) at Deep Dish Swift 2025!
